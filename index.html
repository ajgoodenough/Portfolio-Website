      <h2>A Little About Me</h2>
        <p>For as long as I can remember, I have been surrounded by technology. Whether it was computers, phones, cameras, or the latest video game, technology has always had my full attention. I decided not too long ago to give software engineering and web development the attention that they deserve.</p>
        <p>Prior to that decision to give it my full attention, I was a NCAA Division 1 Water Polo player. I was able to learn so many viable skills throughout my career. The most valuable, however, being my teamwork skills. Because water polo is such a unique sport being originated in Europe, most of my teammates were European (Serbian, Croatian, Montenegran, Italian, etc.). This made communicating very difficult as their first language was not English. But after learning how valuable team chemistry was, we all dedicated ourselves to our craft and made each other better. You never know the value of working collaboratively unless you try to work this out. This experience has made me very open and willing to work with all sorts of individuals.</p>
        <p>Outside of water polo, I have many interests. I love video games. My favorite game right now is the God of War series. They have absolutely captivated me with that storyline. I also enjoy bike riding and spending time with my wonderful girlfriend who I plan to marry in the near future.</p>
